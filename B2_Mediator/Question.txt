CSE 314 – Software Engineering Sessional
Online on Behavioral Patterns

Subsection: B2
Time: 20 minutes

You are developing a Smart Home Automation Hub. You have various devices: a Light Sensor, Automatic Blinds, and an Air Conditioner.

To keep the system organized, the devices should not talk to each other directly. Instead, they all report to the Central Hub.

When the Light Sensor detects "High Brightness," it notifies the Hub. The Hub then tells the Blinds to close.

When the Blinds close, they notify the Hub. The Hub then tells the Air Conditioner to turn on because the room will get stuffy.

Task: Choose the appropriate design pattern to solve this problem and implement a minimal demonstration.
